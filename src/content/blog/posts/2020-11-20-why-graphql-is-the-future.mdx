### A Gentle Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source query language developed by Facebook in 2015 and it is built on the graph data structure. Many big companies are adopting GraphQL besides Facebook, including GitHub, Pinterest, Twitter, Sky, The New York Times, Shopify, Yelp and many others.

### REST APIs

REST (Representational state transfer) is the widely used web architecture as it is flexible and simple to use. It is a convention used to manipulate the collection of data hosted on the server. With common rules around HTTP request methods and uniform URL structure, it is used for creating, updating, reading, and deleting the data on the server.

### HTTP Methods

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless protocol, which means that the client and server know how to handle the data for each individual instance of a request. Once the browser initiates the request, the server will send a response back to the client. On every request initialized, a new connection is established between client and server. The HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
- GET: It is used to retrieve all the information from the server using the URI and should - not modify any of the data
- POST: It is used to send data to the server and to create new resources
- PATCH: It is used to update and partially modify the resource
- PUT: It is used to replace the resource entirely, unlike the PATCH method
- DELETE: This will delete the resource

### What is GraphQL?

A Graph is a data structure that contains nodes and a relationship between two nodes which is referred to as edges.
 Let’s look at some of GraphQL’s salient features:

- GraphQL is strongly-typed, which ensures that the query is valid within the GraphQL type system before execution, i.e. at development time, the server can make certain guarantees on the structure of the response, which makes GraphQL powerful.
- GraphQL provides an efficient (no over-fetching and under-fetching of the data) and more understandable way to consume APIS
- It can be used with any backend framework or programming language
- It helps to add new fields and types to GraphQL API without impacting your existing queries and without creating several versions of the same API
- GraphQL exposes a single endpoint
- GraphQL is self-documenting
