### Test website security with [Snyk's](https://snyk.io/) newest [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) integration

Snyk aims to help developers secure use of open source code. Snyk enables development teams to move quickly and securely by automatically finding and fixing issues faster than industry average.

Snyk’s tools let you find these issues early, fix them quickly, and respond quickly when a new vulnerability is disclosed,” adds Podjarny. “The new GitHub integration brings these security controls into your GitHub workflow, embedding Snyk’s tests on each proposed code change, and submitting the code changes to fix the problem with a click of a button. Once you’re vulnerability free, Snyk will track your dependencies and alert you when a new disclosed vulnerability affects your application, submitting the code changes to fix the problem at the same time”.

In terms of cost, Podjarny says Snyk is free for open source projects, and its command line testing functionality is also free. In addition, the startup offers premium packages that focus on productivity and response time.

“They offer the most efficient way to fix security issues, prevent new ones and respond to new vulnerability alerts,” he says. Snyk’s self-serve products start from as little as $19/month, and scale up to enterprise scale.
