### Gatsby.js consists of React.js, GraphQL, Webpack and other modern technologies.

It follows the “no build configurations” principle, This means that if you are a PHP developer who wants to learn React.js or GraphQL you can go for it and do it without losing your time and motivation into learning build tools. You can install the project and continue building prototypes and products. To an extend, Gatsby.js is similar to [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/).

Gatsby is one of the cool kids in the Frontend Development space right now. Why? I think the reasons are:
- the explosion of the JAMstack approach to building Web Apps and Web Sites
- the rapid adoption of the Progressive Web Apps technology in the industry, which is one of the key features of Gatsby
- it’s built in React and GraphQL, which are two very popular and rising technologies
- it’s really powerful
- it’s fast
- the documentation is great
- the network effect (people use it, create sites, make tutorials, people know more about it, creating a cycle)
- everything is JavaScript (no need to learn a new templating language)
- it hides the complexity, in the beginning, but allows us access into every step to customize

All those are great points, and Gatsby is definitely worth a look.

### How does it work?

With Gatsby, your applications are built using React components.

The content you’ll render in a site is generally written using Markdown, but you can use any kind of data source, like an headless CMS or a web service like Contentful.

Gatsby builds the site, and it’s compiled to static HTML which can be deployed on any Web Server you want, like Netlify, AWS S3, GitHub Pages, regular hosting providers, PAAS and more. All you need is a place that serves plain HTTP pages and your assets to the client.

I mentioned Progressive Web Apps in the list. Gatsby automatically generates your site as a PWA, with a service worker that speeds up page loading and resource caching.

You can enhance the functionality of Gatsby via plugins.
