The [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) or React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It has grown as one of the best libraries in recent years for component-based GUI development.

Although, there are other front-end frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) available, what sets React apart from others is, it just focuses on component-based GUI development and doesnâ€™t invade other areas.
