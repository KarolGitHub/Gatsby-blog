Gatsby.js consists of React.js, GraphQL, Webpack and other modern technologies. It follows the “no build configurations” principle, This means that if you are a PHP developer who wants to learn React.js or GraphQL you can go for it and do it without losing your time and motivation into learning build tools. You can install the project and continue building prototypes and products. To an extend, Gatsby.js is similar to [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/).
